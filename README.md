# Simple programming language, Built on Python.

Welcome! You have encountered with a project im making right now.
For your first interaction with Strip, open the "shell.py" file and input any word.

An error will pop up!

`Strip >>>  hello world
Illegal Character: 'h'
File <stdin>, line 1`

In the shell, you cannot use any letters, only numbers! This is just the start.
Ill continue with the project to make it actually "useful", I doubt it will ever become useful,
but welp, i'll give it a chance! :)
